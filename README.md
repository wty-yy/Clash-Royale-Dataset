# Clash Royale Dataset

This dataset is specially designed to extract the image feature in game Clash Royale, including object detection (visual object classes, VOC), optical character recognition (OCR) and card classification.

## Dataset struct

### Images

- `/images/part1`: Crop the upper right corner of the origin image for the current **time**.
- `/images/part2`: Crop the middle main part of the origin image for the **Arena**.
- `/images/part3`: Crop the bottom of the origin image for the current **deck**.
- `/version_info`: Memory informations for every dataset version and change between the neighbor version.

```bash
CR/images/part{1,2,3}/video_name/episode/frame.jpg
```

#### Object Detection
**Undone, Working on**
```bash
# Associate with `CR/images/part2`
CR/images/part2/video_name/episode/frame.txt
```

#### OCR
**Undone**
```bash
# Associate with `CR/images/part{1,4}`, respectively
CR/images/part1/video_name/episode/frame.txt
```

#### Classification
**Undone**
```bash
# Associate with `CR/images/part3`
CR/card_labels/part3/video_name/episode/frame.txt
```

### Cards & Units

Until 2023/10/30, there are 116 different cards in Royale (include evolution cards). Card names can be found at [`katacv/constants/card_list.py`](https://github.com/wty-yy/KataCR/blob/master/katacr/constants/card_list.py).

But the card name is not completely, because the unit for different card could be same. So, we use unit name to distinguish different units, they can be found at [`katacv/constants/unit_list.py`](https://github.com/wty-yy/KataCR/blob/master/katacr/constants/unit_list.py). There are $127$ different units in Royale (include card unit, `queen-tower`, `king-tower`, 13 spells and 3 objects, see detail state).

#### Detail state

We add 1 types of states for each detection objectï¼Œ1 is predicted by YOLO, 2 are constants.

```vim
# Need predict:
blong:				0/1  # firend/enermy after card name

# Constants:
height:				ground/air
object:				unit/object
```

- `object`: 
  - Spells (13): `zap`, `giant-snowball`, `rage`, `the-log`, `arrows`, `earthquake`, `clone`, `tornado`, `fireball`, `freeze`, `poison`, `rocket`, `lightning`
  - Others: `dirt`(`miner`, `goblin-drill`, `mighty-miner`), `bowl`(`bowler`), `axe`(`executioner`)

### Bar

There are three types of bar in Royale:

- `tower-bar`: The health bar of queen tower.
- `king-tower-bar`: The health bar of king tower.
- `bar`: The bar of card unit.

### Others

- `selected`: The card is selected. (translucent state)
- `clock`: The little clock when card is deployed.
- `emote`: Just emotes were sent by players.
- `text`: All the text, such as `Good luck!`, `FIGHT!`, etc.
- `elixir`: When deploy a unit, there will appear a elixir with the cost.
- `evolution-symbol`: The purple diamond symbol appears when enemy evolution units are deployed.
